# Lunar Lander-v2
This environment is part of the [Box2D environments](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/box2d/) from the [gym](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/) library. 
## Description
Lunar Lander-v2 has been tested using ***Deep Q Learning***, ***Policy Gradient*** and ***Actor Critic*** algorithms. During the training, it was noticed that the environment was solved the fastest with the Deep Q Learning algorithm.
